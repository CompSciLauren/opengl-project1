# OpenGL Two Smiley Faces

This is my first OpenGL project. When the program runs, you will be able to switch between two different views to see two different versions of a smiley face.

## How to Run Program in Terminal

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Inside project1 folder, run `make` command
3. Type `./main Project1_SampleData.txt`
4. Press `n` to view n points and `m` to view m points

## What it Looks Like

Here are the two smiley faces you can view. Press `n` to view the first one and `m` to view the second one.
