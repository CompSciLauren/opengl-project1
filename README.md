# OpenGL Two Smiley Faces

This is my first OpenGL project. When the program runs, you will be able to switch between two different views to see two different versions of a smiley face.

## How to Run Program in Terminal

1. Inside project1 folder, run `make` command
2. Type `./main Project1_SampleData.txt`
3. Press `n` to view n points and `m` to view m points

## What it Looks Like

Here are the two smiley faces you can view. The first one is viewed by pressing `n` and the second one is viewed by pressing `m`.
